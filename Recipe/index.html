    Meatloaf is a dish of ground meat combined with other ingredients, formed into the shape of a loaf, then baked or smoked.
    It tastes very good.
</p>
<h2> Ingredients</h2>
<h3> For the meatloaf (yields 6-8 servings)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing</li>
    <li>1 large yellow onion, finely chopped (about 2 cups)</li>
    <li>5 large garlic cloves, minced (about 2 tablespoons)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
    <li>3(½-inch-thick) slices white sandwich bread (about 3 ounces), torn into small pieces </li>
    <li>⅔ cup whole milk</li>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>¼ cup coarsely chopped fresh flat-leaf or curly parsley</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) or 1 tablespoon coarse kosher salt or fine salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
    <li> pounds meatloaf mix (or any combination of ground beef, pork and/or veal)</li>
</ul>
<h2>For the Tomato Glaze</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>Chopped fresh parsley, for serving (optional)</li>

    </ul>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Make the meatloaf: Heat oven to 350 degrees and grease a rimmed baking sheet with oil. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a medium skillet over medium. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir in tomato paste until well combined; let cool.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine bread and milk, and mash with a spoon until a paste forms.</li>
    <li>Add eggs, parsley, salt, pepper, thyme and cooled onion mixture and mix until well blended.</li>
    <li>Add the beef, pork and veal, and mix gently to combine, being careful not to overwork the meat.</li>
    <li>Divide mixture into 2 equal portions and shape each into a 4-by-8-inch meatloaf on the prepared baking sheet. (If you like, use an 8-inch loaf pan to shape each meatloaf before unmolding for baking.)</li>
<li>Make the glaze: In a small bowl, whisk together ketchup and Worcestershire sauce until smooth. Use a spoon to spread mixture over the top and sides of each meatloaf.</li>
<li>Bake until nicely browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center of meatloaf registers 160 degrees, 45 to 55 minutes. Let rest for 15 minutes before sprinkling the top with fresh parsley, if using, and slicing.</li>
